          As a software developer with a diverse background in digital marketing, the arts, and teaching, I bring a unique perspective to my work. My passion for human-centered design is informed by my experience as a teaching artist in the world of theater, where I learned the importance of empathy and collaboration in creating engaging experiences for diverse audiences. With expertise in React frameworks and a commitment to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies, I am adept at developing functional designs that are both innovative and user-friendly. As a communicator and team player, I value open dialogue and welcome feedback as an opportunity for growth.
